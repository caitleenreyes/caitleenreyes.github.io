## About Me

I am a rising junior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Human-Centered Computing and Financial Literacy. My passion lies at the intersection of technology, human interaction, and biological sciences. I am keen to explore the disciplines of intuitive user experiences in interactive media and the impactful applications of bioinformatics. Eager to immerse myself in both the tech and business worlds, I aspire to blend my technical skills with business expertise to innovate and collaborate with others for meaningful advancements.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I appreciate being explorative through activities such as traveling and trying new cuisines. I also enjoy working out, swimming, photography, and spending time with my friends and family. Ultimately, I strive to fully enjoy and cherish all the memories I create along the way.

## About My Mentor

Dr. Orit Peleg’s research focuses on understanding the behavior of disordered living systems. She comes from a multidisciplinary background holding a B.S. in physics and computer science, a M.S. in physics, and a Ph.D. in material science. As a result, she integrates physics, computer science, biology, and engineering to employ computational techniques from one discipline to answer inquiries in another, pursuing a dynamic approach to her research. Her work targets the comprehension of biological communication signals across various channels (chemical, sound, light, etc.) using insect swarms and plants as model organisms. A significant part of her research involves honeybees, which is where my work contributes. Her honeybee research investigates the bees’ pheromone-based communication and the mechanisms of their swarms’ capabilities to withstand and adapt to environmental fluctuations. Through her extensive research, Dr. Peleg has won numerous awards over the years. She is currently a Principal Investigator at BioFrontiers Institute and is a part of the CU Boulder Computer Science faculty department. Dr. Peleg continues to make critical advancements in science with her groundbreaking research.

Throughout this research experience, I am working closely with Danielle Chase who is a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Peleg’s lab. She has a background in mechanical engineering and works to answer fundamental questions about the mechanics of honeybees.

## About My Project

Honeybees are unique organisms that swarm together to form clusters with unique capabilities. They locate their clustering sites by communicating the queen’s location as signal amplifiers using pheromone-based information. Previous research has suggested the behavioral hypothesis that bees individually respond to local variations in strain. To test this hypothesis, the Peleg lab conducted experiments where they attached pendant conical clusters to a board and shook them with varying amplitude, frequency, orientation, and total duration. The results showed that the horizontally shaken clusters adapted to the dynamic loads by spreading out to construct wider, flatter cones that could recover their original structures when unloaded. As a result, the study highlighted how the collective dynamics of super-organisms allow them to function in ways that single organisms cannot. Honeybee swarms can actively change its morphology in response to dynamic loading, increasing the average mechanical burden experienced by individual bees to promote the collective stability of the cluster. My research aims to further and deepen our understanding of the capabilities of both individual bees and swarms. We look to improve our tracking of bees through the analysis of x-ray imaging and labeling to better examine individual and collective behaviors. By advancing these techniques, we hope to discover new insights into the intricate coordination mechanisms within honeybee swarms.
