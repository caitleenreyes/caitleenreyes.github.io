## About Me

I am a rising junior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Human-Centered Computing and Financial Literacy. My passion lies at the intersection of technology, human interaction, and biological sciences. I am keen to explore the disciplines of intuitive user experiences in interactive media and the impactful applications of bioinformatics. Eager to immerse myself in both the tech and business worlds, I aspire to blend my technical skills with business expertise to innovate and collaborate with others for meaningful advancements.

Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I appreciate being explorative through activities such as traveling and trying new foods. I also enjoy working out, swimming, and spending time with my friends, family, and dog. I strive to embrace and capture these experiences through photography.
