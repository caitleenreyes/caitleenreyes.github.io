title: Week 7
---

During Week 7, I kept labeling the small swarm on Slicer and began working on programming the analysis of the small swarm.
- Generated a histogram of the bee size distribution
- Calculated the center of mass for each connected component and the values into a list of (x,y,z) centers
- Plotted 3D point clouds of the bee positions using the center of mass of each bee, both with and without the centroid marked
- Generated histograms of the r and z positions separately to see the distribution of bees in each direction
- Calculated the average distance between a bee and its nearest neighbors
       - Created two lists of the mean distances to the nearest three and six neighbors
       - Calculated the overall average distance to the nearest three neighbors
       - Calculated the overall average distance to the nearest three neighbors
- Plotted the mean distance lists for three and six neighbors as functions of the r and z coordinates
       - Generated histograms using binning
       - Plotted scatter plots using direct plotting
- Plotted 3D plots using the centers of mass for each connected component, with points colored according to a scale representing the average distance to their three or six nearest neighbors
- Calculated the principal axis of each bee (a 3D unit vector)
- Plotted scatter plots to visualize the angles made with each bee's principal axis and the z-axis as functions of the r and z coordinates
- Plotted a 3D plot to depictindividual bees, colored by the angle of their principal axes with respect to the z-axis

I also programed code tht allowed me to identify any disconnected components in my labeling on Slicer. The purpose of the program was to ensure I did not accidentally clicked on a random pixel associated with a bee I am attempting to label.
