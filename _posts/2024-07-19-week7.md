title: Week 7
---

During Week 7, I kept labeling the small swarm on Slicer and began working on programming the analysis of the small swarm.
- Generated a histogram of the bee size distribution
- Calculated the center of mass for each connected component and placed the values into a list of (x,y,z) centers
- Plotted 3D point clouds of the bee positions using the center of mass of each bee, both with and without the centroid marked
- Generated histograms of the r and z positions separately to see the distribution of bees in each direction
- Calculated the average distance between a bee and its nearest neighbors
1. Created two lists of the mean distances to the nearest three and six neighbors for each bee
2. Calculated the overall average distance to the nearest three neighbors
3. Calculated the overall average distance to the nearest three neighbors
- Plotted the mean distance lists to the nearest three and six neighbors of each bee as functions of the r and z coordinates
1. Generated histograms using binning
2. Plotted scatter plots using direct plotting
- Plotted 3D plots using the centers of mass for each connected component, with points colored according to a scale representing the average distance to their three or six nearest neighbors
- Calculated the principal axis of each bee (a 3D unit vector)
- Plotted scatter plots to visualize the angles made with each bee's principal axis and the z-axis as functions of the r and z coordinates
- Plotted a 3D plot to depict individual bees, colored by the angle of their principal axes with respect to the z-axis

I also programed code that allowed me to identify any disconnected components in my labeling on Slicer. The purpose of the program was to ensure that I did not accidentally clicked on a random pixel associated with a bee I am attempting to label.
