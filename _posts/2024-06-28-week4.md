title: Week 4

The fourth week began with me creating a separate Jupyter notebook to be able to load the previously saved file path of a training data model with a specified weight (original, halved, doubled channels of neural network code) and test it against a dataset of choice. As a result, I used the file paths I had previously saved to continue documenting in my UNet Journal.
- Documented the original neural network code as trained data and compared it with the dataset of another undergraduate student, Nina, who is working with me in Dr. Peleg’s lab, Nina.
- Documented the halved channels neural network code as trained data against Nina’s dataset
- Documented the doubled channels neural network code as trained data against Nina’s dataset

I updated the neural network to be able to accept multiple training samples. I also worked on labeling the small swarm on Slicer.
