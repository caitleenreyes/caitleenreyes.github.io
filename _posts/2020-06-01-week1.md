title: Week 1

The first week began with a tour of the Jennie Smoly Caruthers Biotechnology Building at CU Boulder which is where Dr. Peleg’s lab is located. I discussed with Danielle Chase, a postdoctoral fellow in Peleg’s lab that I am working closely with, her research with honeybee swarms, what I should expect to work on throughout the summer, and resources to learn more about the foundational topics in our research and Dr. Peleg’s research. I also downloaded Slicer which is software that is used to label x-ray images of the honeybees. The next day, Daniella gave a Slicer tutorial using a small dataset consisting of a cubed portion of an x-ray image of the honeybee swarm. I continued to label the honeybees on Slicer throughout the week. The purpose of the labeling is to create training data for the neural network to learn what is a bee and what is not a bee in the x-ray images.
