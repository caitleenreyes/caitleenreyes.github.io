title: Week 6
---

I continued working on labeling the small swarm on Slicer throughout Week 6. I also continued to document in my UNet Journal.
- Documented using the original neural network code, trained with my dataset and Ninaâ€™s dataset, and tested against my dataset
I also discussed with Danielle what the next steps were for the small swarm analysis. Our goal is to analyze the properties of the small labeled swarm, which can eventually be extended to segmented swarms. The next steps included creating code that calculates and plots various information about the swarm.
