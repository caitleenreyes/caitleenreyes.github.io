I continued working on labeling the small swarm on Slicer throughout Week 6. I also continued to document in my UNet Journal.
- Documented using the original neural network code, trained with my dataset and Ninaâ€™s dataset, and tested against my dataset

I also discussed with Danielle what the next steps were for the small swarm analysis. Our goal is to analyze the properties of the small labeled swarm, which can eventually be extended to segmented swarms. The next steps included creating code that calculates and plots various information about the swarm.

On Thursday, I attended a lab meeting where graduate and postdoctoral researchers in the Peleg lab presented their research. This summer, the Peleg lab is focused on two topics: fireflies and honeybees. During the meeting, I learned about the different methods they are using to answer various questions related to these topics. It was fascinating to hear about the specific questions the firefly researchers are trying to answer and to learn about the entire scope of research the lab is conducting to understand honeybees.
