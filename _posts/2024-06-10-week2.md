title: Week 2

I started Week 2 by downloading JupyterLab on my personal computer. I will be using JupyterLab as the interface to develop code for the neural network. I continued working on labeling the honeybees on Slicer until I had a completed labeled cube. I conducted a preliminary analysis of the image data that is the input to the neural network which consisted of creating histograms at different thresholds to view the different outputs of sizes/number of pixels vs. number of connected components, creating a 3D visualization of my labeled data using Napari, and creating a histogram of my labeled data plotting the sizes/number of pixels vs. number of components/number of bees (it is essentially a histogram of the different bee sizes in my labeled data). I then extensively reviewed over step-by-step the neural network code with Danielle.
