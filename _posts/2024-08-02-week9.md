title: Week 9
---

Week 9 was my final week in Boulder, Colorado. I continued to progress my labeling of the small swarm on Slicer. I also worked on ehancing my 3D visualization of the small swarm in ParaView, testing different methods to create a .vtk file of my swarm segmentation file.
- Plotted points that were connected by lines for each bee
- Plotted ellipsoids (elongated spheres) for each bee

I helped someone from the Peleg lab extract honey on Wednesday. We took out eight frames from the hives and had to shake them to remove the bees. Then, we uncapped the honeycombs and used the extractor that uses centrifugal force to extrace honey from the combs. Afterwards, the honey is trained into jars for storage.

I had my last in-person meeting with Danielle.
- Discussed each attempt I made at plotting the segmented bees in a 3D visual on ParaView
- Decided to proceed with the ellipsoid meethod and improve upon my initial attempt by adjusting the scaling of the ellipsoid's x, y, and z radii to better resemble the bees on Slicer.
- Gone over what I needed to compile by next week for the documentation of my work for the lab's records
